- 🎵 Pick any public Spotify playlist and the app will try to match each track to osu! beatmaps.
- 📊 You can filter, sort and search results with all the options provided by osu search queries and even custom one.
- 💾 Once you're happy with the results, you can download each beatmap individually — or grab them all in a single zip archive.

### Try it out!

I hope you find this tool useful and fun to use. I really put soul in it.
Thanks for checking it out — and even bigger thanks if you decide to give it a try!💗

ThunderBirdo featured my app in [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uZ4RehxDO4&t=300s&ab_channel=ThunderBirdo)! Just note: the map background issue on cards is already fixed, and the video only covers the `from-osu` page.
